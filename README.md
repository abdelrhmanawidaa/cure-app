# Installation
To install Cure, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip by running **pip install -r requirements.txt** in your command line.
3. Run the database migrations by running **python manage.py makemigrations** followed by **python manage.py migrate**.
4. Start the development server by running **python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000**.
5. You can also run the Docker container by running **docker build -t app .** followed by **docker run -d -p 8000:8000 app**.


# Usage
To use Cure, open a web browser and navigate to **http://localhost:8000/**. From there, you can access the various features, including educational resources, health tracking tools, and the retina scan feature.

# Deployment to Production
To deploy your application to production, you can use Terraform to create the necessary infrastructure resources on AWS.

1. Create an AWS account if you haven't already done so.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the **terraform** directory.
4. edit **image** with your docker image in ecs task.
5. Run **terraform init** to initialize the Terraform environment.
6. Run **terraform apply** to create the infrastructure resources on AWS. This will create a VPC, two subnets, two ECS Fargate tasks, and an Application Load Balancer.
It will also pull the latest image from your Docker Hub repository and deploy it to the Fargate tasks.
7. Once the infrastructure resources are created, you can view your application by going to the URL of the Application Load Balancer.
You can find this URL in the Terraform output.
The output should look something like this: load_balancer_url = "http://my-load-balancer-1234567890.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com"

Note: Don't forget to destroy the Terraform resources when you're done testing to avoid incurring unnecessary costs. You can do this by running **terraform destroy**.
